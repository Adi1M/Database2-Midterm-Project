- Explanation of why the structure follows normal forms

1.	Category:
This table has a single primary key column, 'category_id', and a single non-key column, 'category_name'. This means it is in First Normal Form (1NF). It is also in Second Normal Form (2NF) because there are no partial dependencies, meaning that each non-key column is dependent on the entire primary key. There are no transitive dependencies, so it is also in Third Normal Form (3NF).

2.	Publisher:
This table has a single primary key column, 'publisher_id', and two non-key columns, 'publisher_name' and 'address'. It is in 1NF because each column has an atomic value. It is in 2NF because 'publisher_name' and 'address' are dependent only on the primary key column. It is also in 3NF because there are no transitive dependencies.

3.	Author:
This table has a single primary key column, 'author_id', and two non-key columns, 'author_name' and 'contact_information'. It is in 1NF because each column has an atomic value. It is in 2NF because 'author_name' and 'contact_information' are dependent only on the primary key column. It is also in 3NF because there are no transitive dependencies.

4.	Customer:
This table has a single primary key column, 'customer_id', and three non-key columns, 'customer_name', 'address', and 'contact_information'. It is in 1NF because each column has an atomic value. It is in 2NF because 'customer_name', 'address', and 'contact_information' are dependent only on the primary key column. It is also in 3NF because there are no transitive dependencies.

5.	OrderHeader:
This table has a single primary key column, 'order_id', and two non-key columns, 'order_date' and 'customer_id'. It is in 1NF because each column has an atomic value. It is in 2NF because 'order_date' and 'customer_id' are dependent only on the primary key column. It is also in 3NF because there are no transitive dependencies.

6.	Book:
This table has a single primary key column, 'book_id', and five non-key columns, 'title', 'author_id', 'category_id', 'publisher_id', and 'price'. It is in 1NF because each column has an atomic value. It is in 2NF because 'title', 'author_id', 'category_id', 'publisher_id', and 'price' are dependent only on the primary key column. It is also in 3NF because there are no transitive dependencies.

7.	OrderDetail:
This table has a single primary key column, 'order_detail_id', and four non-key columns, 'order_id', 'book_id', 'quantity', and 'price'. It is in 1NF because each column has an atomic value. It is in 2NF because 'order_id', 'book_id', 'quantity', and 'price' are dependent only on the primary key column. It is also in 3NF because there are no transitive dependencies.


- TRIGGERS

before_insert_show_row_count - These triggers are responsible for executing the 'show_row_count' function, that will count number of rows before insert.

change_numberof_quantity -  This trigger is responsible for executing the 'change_quantity' function, that will take quantity from 'orderdetail' table and minus from quantity in table 'book'.
example: if we have 50 copies of 'The Da Vinci Code' and someone bye 3 copies of 'The Da Vinci Code', in 'book' table quantity of this book will be 47.

- PROCEDURES

group_books_by_publisher() - Procedure which does group by information

update_book_price() - Procedure which uses ROW_COUNT to determine the number of rows affected

- FUNCTIONS

check_title_length() - This function work with its trigger, if title's length less than 5 , then raise USER DEFINED EXCEPTION
